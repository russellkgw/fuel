Worked though the LSTM book, got something to work with reshaping

Most time spent wrangling data

Using the actual value instead of % change

Struggled with large errors using actual value, but have implemented feature scaling
(mean normalization)

Using the future oil prices and exchange rates

Spoke to a fund manager about oil vs gold, said that there is correlation
but not sufficient to model

used a 3 month sequence of data

Built 3 models using Keras: FFNN, RNN, CNN

FFNN:
average train: 0.003
average test: 0.002

RNN:
average train: 0.02
average test: 0.002

CNN:
average train: 0.005
average test: 0.04

average train: 0.06
average test: 0.007

less pooling layers yielded better results


norm, test set seperate

upper bound of mean using actual vs % change


questions for models ?

how far back, 10 years ? 5 years ?

data oil and excha vs all

search sequence models where data is not complete oil future/oil

what are people currently using?

make basic linear regression.

how deep, how many layers.

epochs ?

into ro fx rates, commodoties, derivatives
